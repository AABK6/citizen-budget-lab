# Product Guidelines

## Tone & Prose Style
*   **Rigorous but Engaging:** Maintain a professional and analytical foundation while using accessible language. The tone should be neutral and fact-based but not "dry."
*   **Gamified Discovery:** Use elements of gamification to make exploration fun and rewarding. Avoid being preachy or "boring."
*   **Balanced Neutrality:** Strictly avoid political bias in core data descriptions, but allow for engaging and active language in the simulation feedback.

## Visual Design
*   **Data-Dense Clarity:** Prioritize visualizations that pack a lot of information (like treemaps and interactive charts) but remain highly legible and intuitive.
*   **Desktop First (Initial):** Focus on a high-quality desktop experience for complex data manipulation, with mobile responsiveness as a secondary priority.

## Gamification & Engagement
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Every adjustment must trigger immediate, animated visual feedback in charts and counters.
*   **Subtle Collective Comparison:** Show the "Citizen Consensus" primarily *after* the user submits their vote. During simulation, use light touches (e.g., "Trending Levers" or subtle badges) to show popular choices without overwhelming the user or biasing their initial exploration.
*   **Scenario Exploration:** Reward curiosity and exploration of different fiscal paths rather than pushing for a specific outcome like a balanced budget.
*   **Achievements & Badges:** Use subtle achievements to acknowledge depth of exploration or unique fiscal combinations.

## Neutrality & Credibility
*   **Sourced Data Mandate:** Every budget line and policy lever must be linked to a verifiable source (Eurostat, INSEE, official reports). This is the project's "hard requirement."
*   **Transparent Methodology:** The "LEGO" mapping logic and simulation assumptions must be accessible to users to ensure the "auditable sandbox" promise.

## Virality & Sharing
*   **Impact Snapshots:** Automatically generate visual "share cards" that highlight the most significant changes a user made (e.g., "My budget prioritizes Green Investment").
*   **Robust Permalinks:** Support deep-linking to specific simulation states so users can debate exact configurations.
*   **Social Proof:** Integrate counters and trends from the collective submissions to show the tool's real-world impact and community activity.
