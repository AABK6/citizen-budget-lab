# Citizen Budget Lab (France)

*A public, transparent, and interactive app to explore French public spending and test “what‑if” scenarios—with credible macro and distributional impacts.*

---

## 1. Overview

**Problem:** Public debate on budgets is polarized and opaque. Citizens rarely see who spends what, for what outcomes, and what trade‑offs reforms imply.

**Solution:** Citizen Budget Lab is a web app that aggregates open French public‑finance data, allowing users to explore the budget, build their own scenarios, and see the potential impacts of their choices.

**Impact:** Improve understanding and trust by making trade‑offs tangible and sourced. Enable better media coverage and civic education; give policymakers a neutral, auditable sandbox.
