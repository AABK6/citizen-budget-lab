# Docs archive

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer an accurate description of the repo's current behavior.

Keep archived docs for:
- decision history,
- implementation notes that might help future refactors,
- traceability.

Archived items (non-exhaustive):
- `UX_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`
- `tutorial-review.md`
- `admin_lens_migration.md`
- `design_mockups/`

If you resurrect an archived plan, create a new "current" doc at `docs/` and link back here.
