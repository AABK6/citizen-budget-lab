# Docs archive

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer an accurate description of the repo's current behavior.

Keep archived docs for:
- decision history,
- implementation notes that might help future refactors,
- traceability.

Archived items (non-exhaustive):
- `UX_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`
- `tutorial-review.md`
- `admin_lens_migration.md`
- `design_mockups/`
- `BUG_REPORT_SCENARIO_RACE.md`
- `session_2026-02-26_budget-baseline-log.md`
- `treemap_diff_vs_live_2026.md`
- `verification_lfi2026_missions.md`
- `verification_lfi2026_state_a.md`
- `verification_lfss2026.md`
- `verification_apul2026.md`

If you resurrect an archived plan, create a new "current" doc at `docs/` and link back here.
