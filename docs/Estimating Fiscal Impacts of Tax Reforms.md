# **Comprehensive Fiscal and Economic Impact Assessment of the 2026 Budgetary Amendments (PLF & PLFSS)**

## **Executive Summary: The 2026 Fiscal Turning Point**

The legislative examination of the *Projet de Loi de Finances* (PLF) and the *Projet de Loi de Financement de la Sécurité Sociale* (PLFSS) for the year 2026 takes place in a fiscal environment of unprecedented tension. Faced with a public deficit that has drifted significantly from European stability targets—forecasted to reach 5.4% of GDP in 2025 and aiming for a reduction to 4.7% in 2026—the French legislature has engaged in a high-stakes search for revenue.1 This report provides an exhaustive, forensic analysis of fifteen specific fiscal amendments and measures that form the backbone of this budgetary adjustment.

The analysis reveals a profound dichotomy in the 2026 budgetary strategy. On one side, there is a push from the National Assembly, often driven by the "Nouveau Front Populaire" and cross-party alliances, to implement structural taxes on wealth accumulation (financial holdings, share buybacks, super-dividends) with theoretical yields in the billions. On the other side, the Senate and the Government have favored "yield management" strategies—nuanced adjustments to social expenditures (pensions, sick leave, healthcare deductibles) and moderate tax increases designed to preserve economic attractiveness while signaling fiscal seriousness.

This document details the fiscal mechanics, projected yields (in euros), and socio-economic ripple effects of these measures. It synthesizes data from parliamentary reports, impact studies, and legislative debates to provide a granular view of the 2026 fiscal landscape.

**I. Structural Wealth Taxation and High-Net-Worth Adjustments**

The 2026 budget debates have been characterized by a philosophical rupture regarding the taxation of capital. The shift from taxing "flows" (income) to taxing "stocks" (wealth) has re-emerged as a central theme, driven by the need to finance the ecological transition and reduce sovereign debt.

### **1\. Transformation of the Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière (IFI) into a Tax on Unproductive Wealth**

The proposal to transform the existing *Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière* (IFI) into a broader *Impôt sur la Fortune Improductive* (Tax on Unproductive Wealth) represents the most significant challenge to the fiscal doctrine established in 2018\.

#### **Legislative Mechanism and Definition**

Since 2018, the IFI has strictly targeted real estate assets, exempting financial assets to encourage investment in the "productive" economy. The 2026 amendments seek to reverse this by redefining what constitutes "productive" capital. The proposed tax base would be expanded to include:

* **Luxury Movable Assets:** Yachts, private jets, luxury cars, and racehorses, which are currently exempt from IFI unless held through a company structure.  
* **Financial Assets in Holding Companies:** The core of the reform targets cash accumulations and passive financial investments held within patrimonial holding companies, effectively piercing the corporate veil that currently shields these assets from wealth taxation.3

#### **Fiscal Impact Analysis**

Current IFI yield stands at approximately **€2.4 billion** annually. The revenue potential of the transformation varies drastically based on the aggressive nature of the "unproductive" definition:

| Scenario | Scope of Assets Included | Estimated Additional Yield (2026) | Total Projected Yield |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Minimalist** | Luxury goods (yachts, jets, horses) only | \+€50 Million \- €100 Million | \~€2.5 Billion |
| **Intermediate** | Luxury goods \+ Cash \> €10M in Holdings | \+€1.5 Billion | \~€3.9 Billion |
| **Maximalist** | Reintegration of all non-business financial assets (quasi-ISF) | \+€4.5 Billion \- €5.0 Billion | \~€7.0 \- 7.5 Billion |

**Data Synthesis:** The Senate's adoption of a revised IFI that includes certain financial assets but excludes real estate used for business operations suggests a compromise. The Senate's version aims to broaden the base without triggering capital flight, estimating a yield reduction of **€600 million** compared to the maximalist proposals, but still representing a net increase over the current IFI.5 The "unproductive" label attempts to bypass the criticism of taxing business capital, focusing instead on "sleeping capital".6

#### **Structural Implications**

The reintroduction of financial assets into the wealth tax base carries significant second-order risks. Critics argue that defining "unproductive" is administratively complex and subjective. For instance, is cash held by a holding company for a future acquisition "unproductive"? The risk is a freeze in capital mobility, where holding companies deploy cash into sub-optimal "active" investments merely to avoid taxation, rather than allocating capital efficiently. Furthermore, this measure serves as a political signal, potentially deterring the domicile of new high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) in France.

### **2\. Indexation of Income Tax (IR) Brackets**

The indexation of the *Barème de l'Impôt sur le Revenu* (IR) is a critical lever for purchasing power. In an inflationary environment, failing to index tax brackets results in a hidden tax increase ("bracket creep").

#### **The 2026 Calibration: 1% vs. Inflation**

With inflation for 2025 forecasted between **1.5% and 1.8%**, the standard policy would be a full indexation to neutralize the effect of inflation on households. However, to generate budgetary savings, an amendment proposed a partial indexation of **1%**.

* **Cost of Full Indexation:** Fully indexing brackets typically "costs" the state (in foregone revenue) between **€5 billion and €6 billion** annually compared to a total freeze.7  
* **The 1% Compromise:** By indexing at only 1%, the state effectively increases the real tax burden on households whose income rises with inflation.  
  * **Fiscal Impact:** This measure is estimated to save the state approximately **€2.5 billion** compared to a full indexation scenario. Conversely, it avoids the drastic shock of a total freeze, which would have extracted nearly €6 billion from households.1

#### **Senate Adjustments and Decile Impact**

The Senate introduced a nuanced modification: prioritizing the full indexation of the *first* tax bracket (11%) to protect low-income earners entering the tax system, while under-indexing the higher brackets (30%, 41%, 45%).

* **Fiscal Consequence:** This targeted approach reduces the savings yield by approximately **€1 billion**, meaning the net gain for the state (vs. full indexation) drops to roughly **€1.5 billion**.9  
* **Redistributive Effect:** This creates a progressive tightening. Middle and upper-middle-class taxpayers (the 17% of households in the 30% bracket) bear the brunt of the fiscal drag, effectively financing the protection of the entry-level taxpayers.

### **3\. Exit Tax Restoration (15-Year Lock-up)**

The "Exit Tax" applies to unrealized capital gains when a taxpayer relocates tax residence abroad. It was diluted in 2019 (holding period reduced to 2 years), leading to accusations of facilitating tax exile.

#### **The 2026 Amendment**

The amendment restores the original **15-year** holding period required before the tax is waived. This means a taxpayer moving abroad must keep their French shares for 15 years (instead of 2\) to avoid paying French capital gains tax on the value accrued while in France.1

#### **Fiscal Yield and Behavioral Economics**

* **Direct Yield:** The direct revenue for 2026 is estimated at a modest **€70 million**.11  
* **Analysis of Low Yield:** The low figure is misleading. The Exit Tax is a *dissuasive* weapon, not a yield weapon. Its primary function is to prevent base erosion. By locking in the tax base for 15 years, it forces entrepreneurs to pay the Flat Tax (30%) or CEHR (contribution on high revenues) in France upon a liquidity event, rather than paying 0% or low rates in jurisdictions like Belgium or Switzerland.  
* **Long-term Impact:** The "real" yield is the preservation of future Capital Gains Tax (PFU) revenue, which amounts to billions annually. Restoring the 15-year window signals a closure of the "fiscal optimization window" opened in 2019\.

### **4\. Taxation of Patrimonial Holding Companies**

This measure targets the "Cash Box" phenomenon, where dividends are trapped in holding companies (taxed at Corporate Tax rates, currently 25%) to avoid the personal income tax (Flat Tax 30%) that would apply upon distribution to the individual shareholder.

#### **The Proposal Mechanics**

The proposal, often conflated with the "Taxe Zucman" discussions, involves a specific levy on the **undistributed net income** or **net assets** of pure patrimonial holding companies (sociétés civiles à prépondérance financière).

* **The "Zucman" Variant:** A forceful tax of 2% on assets or a "deemed distribution" rule was estimated to yield between **€1 billion and €5 billion**.12  
* **The Adopted Reality (Senate):** The Senate significantly watered down the text to exclude "professional assets" and active holding companies. The scope is restricted to passive structures used strictly for tax deferral.  
* **Fiscal Impact (2026):** The revised yield is estimated at **€100 million**.5  
* **Insight:** The collapse in yield from €1bn+ to €100m illustrates the legislative difficulty in defining "abuse." To avoid hurting active family businesses (transmission, reinvestment), the tax base was eroded until the measure became largely symbolic, serving as a warning shot rather than a structural revenue stream.

### **5\. One-Time Donation Exemption ("Dons Familiaux")**

To stimulate the housing market and intergenerational transfer, a temporary exemption was introduced.

#### **The Measure**

A tax exemption on donations of up to **€100,000** (cumulative with existing €100k/15-year allowances) from parents/grandparents to descendants, provided the funds are used for:

1. Purchase of a primary residence (specifically new builds or energy renovation).  
2. Energy renovation works.13

#### **Fiscal Cost and Economic Stimulus**

* **Budgetary Cost:** This is a tax expenditure (lost revenue). Estimates suggest a cost of **€300 million to €500 million** in 2026\.13  
* **Economic Multiplier:** The government rationale is that this cost is recouped via VAT (20%) on construction and renovation. If €2 billion is transferred and spent on taxable renovation, VAT revenue would be €400 million, theoretically neutralizing the cost.  
* **Social Equity:** Critics argue this subsidizes the wealthy (who have €100k to give) and inflates real estate prices, worsening access for those without family wealth. It reinforces the "inheritance society" dynamic noted in inequality studies.

### **6\. Alimony Exemption Shift (Pensions Alimentaires)**

Current law allows alimony payers to deduct payments (reducing their taxable income) while recipients must declare them (increasing their taxable income). Since payers usually earn more than recipients, this reduces overall tax revenue.

#### **The Reform**

The amendment proposes **exempting the recipient** (often single mothers) from tax on alimony, while **removing the deductibility for the payer**.

* **Fiscal Mechanics:** Payer (High Tax Bracket) loses deduction \-\> State gains revenue. Recipient (Low/Zero Tax Bracket) gains exemption \-\> State loses little to no revenue.  
* **Fiscal Impact:** This arbitrage is estimated to generate a **net positive yield of €470 million to €500 million** for the state.15  
* **Social Impact:** This is a purchasing power measure for single-parent families (85% women), effectively transferring tax burden from the custodial parent to the non-custodial earner.

**II. Corporate Taxation: Competitiveness vs. Contribution**

The PLF 2026 navigates a narrow path between maintaining France's "pro-business" supply-side reforms and addressing the public demand for contribution from profitable multinationals.

### **7\. Universal Multinational Tax and Global Minimum Tax Threshold**

France continues the transposition of the OECD Pillar 2 agreement (15% minimum tax).

#### **The 2026 Amendment Landscape**

* **Threshold:** The tax applies to groups with revenue \> **€750 million**. An amendment to raise this to **€2 billion** was debated but conflicts with the EU Directive and OECD rules.16  
* **Yield Estimates:**  
  * **Domestic Top-up Tax (QDMTT):** Expected to yield **€1.5 billion to €2 billion** in 2026 as it captures tax that would otherwise be paid to foreign jurisdictions.17  
  * **Proposed "Universal Targeted Tax":** A separate amendment aimed at specific sectors (digital, energy) to act as a "sovereign" top-up was floated but remains legally fragile.  
  * **Double GAFAM Tax:** A proposal to double the rate of the Digital Services Tax (TSN) was projected to raise revenue from \~€800m to **€1.5 billion**, but risks trade retaliation from the US were cited as a blocking factor.18

### **8\. Taxation of Windfall Dividends and Share Buybacks**

This domain witnessed the most intense parliamentary friction, with the National Assembly pushing for high rates and the Government/Senate minimizing them to prevent capital flight.

#### **Share Buyback Tax (*Rachat d'actions*)**

* **Context:** CAC 40 companies spent over €30 billion on buybacks in 2023\.  
* **The High-Ambition Proposal:** An 8% to 10% tax on the **real market value** of shares repurchased.  
  * *Theoretical Yield:* €30 billion base \* 8% \= **€2.4 billion**.19  
* **The Government/Senate Proposal:** A tax targeted at the **nominal value** or a very low rate (1%) on share reduction.  
  * *Revised Yield:* **€200 million to €260 million**.21  
* **Outcome:** The gap between €2.4bn and €200m illustrates the lobbying power of the financial sector, arguing that a high tax would force companies to delist from the Paris Euronext exchange to Amsterdam or New York. The adopted measure is largely symbolic.23

#### **Windfall Dividends (*Super-dividendes*)**

* **The Proposal:** A temporary surtax (e.g., 5%) on dividends exceeding the average of the last 5 years by 20%.  
* **Fiscal Impact:** Estimates place the yield at **€2 billion to €3 billion**.24  
* **Status:** Despite repeated votes in the Assembly, this measure faces staunch opposition from the executive, citing the stability of the "Flat Tax" (PFU) as a cornerstone of investment attractiveness.

### **9\. Crédit d'Impôt Recherche (CIR) Clawback**

The CIR costs the state **€7 billion to €8 billion** annually. It is often criticized for subsidizing large groups that subsequently delocalize production.

#### **The Clawback Mechanism**

Amendments introduced a conditionality: companies benefiting from CIR must maintain R\&D and production activity in France for a set period (e.g., 5-10 years). Failure triggers a "clawback" (repayment).

* **Fiscal Impact:**  
  * **Direct Yield:** Estimated at **€100 million to €400 million** annually, primarily from non-compliance penalties and a deterrent effect reducing applications from foot-loose entities.25  
  * **Structural Savings:** A reform of the CIR *base* (excluding overheads) could save **€1.5 billion**, but the specific anti-delocalization clawback is a compliance tool rather than a mass revenue generator.3

### **10\. Reduced Corporate Tax (IS) for SMEs**

Currently, SMEs pay 15% IS on the first €42,500 of profit.

* **The Amendment:** Raising the ceiling for the reduced rate to **€100,000**.  
* **Fiscal Cost:** This is a direct loss for the state.  
* **Estimated Impact:** With hundreds of thousands of eligible SMEs, expanding the 15% bracket (vs 25% normal rate) represents a cost of **€2 billion**.26  
* **Rationale:** This is positioned as a support measure for the "productive fabric" of small enterprises facing rising wage and energy costs.

## ---

**III. Social Security and Labor Market Adjustments (PLFSS)**

The Social Security deficit is projected at **€23 billion** for 2025\. The PLFSS 2026 attempts to plug this gap through aggressive expenditure cuts and new levies.

### **11\. Pension Reform: Suspension and Age Changes**

The proposal to suspend the 2023 Pension Reform (which raises the age to 64\) creates a massive actuarial shock.

#### **Fiscal Impact of Suspension**

* **Mechanism:** Freezing the legal age at 62 years and 9 months for the 1964/1965 cohorts instead of proceeding to 63\.  
* **Short-Term Cost (2026):** **€500 million to €600 million** for the single year 2026\.28  
* **Medium-Term Cost:** By 2027, the cost rises to **€1.7 billion**. If fully abrogated, the annual deficit contribution increases to **€18 billion** by 2030\.24  
* **Offset Measure:** To counter this, the government maintained the **CSG increase** on pensions or the **fiscal abatement cap**. Replacing the 10% tax abatement on pensions with a fixed cap (e.g., €2,000) for high earners yields **€439 million to €1 billion**.30

### **12\. Sick Leave Duration (*Jours de Carence*)**

Aligning the public sector with the private sector to reduce absenteeism.

#### **The Measure**

Increasing the waiting period (*jours de carence*) from 1 day to **3 days** for civil servants.

* **Fiscal Savings:**  
  * State Civil Service: **€216 million**.  
  * Territorial/Hospital Civil Service: Additional savings bring the total potential to **€289 million** to **€540 million**.32  
* **Controversy:** Unions argue this penalizes agents who cannot telework, but the Senate views it as a necessary equity measure.

### **13\. Medical Copay (*Franchises Médicales*)**

The government proposed doubling the medical franchise (deductible) on drugs and consultations.

#### **The Proposal**

* **Mechanism:** Increase deductible from €0.50 to €1.00 per box of medicine; extend to medical devices.  
* **Projected Yield:** **€800 million to €1.2 billion**.34  
* **Outcome:** Facing a united front of opposition in the Assembly, the government signaled a retreat. This leaves a **€1 billion hole** in the PLFSS financing plan that must be covered by debt or other undisclosed cuts.34

### **14\. Severance Tax (*Rupture Conventionnelle*)**

To discourage *rupture conventionnelle* (mutual termination) which grants unemployment rights, the cost to employers is increased.

#### **The Measure**

Increasing the "forfait social" (employer contribution) on severance indemnity from 30% to **40%**.

* **Fiscal Yield:** **€260 million** in additional revenue.22  
* **Behavioral Goal:** Keep seniors in employment longer by making exit more expensive, indirectly saving Unédic (unemployment) funds.

### **15\. Transformation of EHPAD Tax Reduction into Dependence Credit**

Currently, EHPAD residents get a tax *reduction* (25% up to €10k). Non-taxable residents get nothing.

#### **The Reform**

Transforming the reduction into a **refundable tax credit**.

* **Cost of Universalization:** Making the benefit available to non-taxable low-income pensioners costs the state an additional **€272 million to €500 million**.36  
* **Total Cost:** The total niche cost rises to \~€770 million.  
* **Financing:** To fund this, the tax credit for *home services* (services à la personne) was targeted for a rate cut (50% \-\> 45%), which would save **€720 million**, effectively acting as a transfer from healthy households using cleaners/gardeners to dependent households in care homes.3

### **16\. Apprentice Aid Cuts (*Aides à l'Apprentissage*)**

The cost of apprenticeship subsidies has exploded to €16-20 billion.

#### **The Measure**

* **Action:** Suppression of social contribution exemptions for apprentices or reduction of the hiring grant (€6,000).  
* **Fiscal Savings:**  
  * Restoring contributions on apprentices: **€1 billion to €1.3 billion**.38  
  * Reducing hiring premiums: Potential savings of **€1 billion**.  
* **Total Impact:** A combined savings package on apprenticeship is estimated to yield **€3 billion**.39

| **Medical Franchise** | Social | Revenue | **\+€800M \- €1.2Md** (Aborted?) | 34 |
| **Severance Tax** | Labor | Revenue | **\+€260M** | 22 |
| **Pension Suspension** | Social | Expenditure | **\-€500M** (2026) / **\-€1.7Md** (2027) | 28 |
| **Apprentice Cuts** | Labor | Savings | **\+€1.0Md \- €3.0Md** | 39 |

**V. Strategic Analysis and Second-Order Insights**

### **1\. The "Yield Gap" and Fiscal Symbolism**

A critical insight from the data is the massive discrepancy between the *proposed* yields of wealth taxes (Taxe Zucman, Buybacks on Real Value) and the *adopted* yields (Holdings Tax, Buybacks on Nominal Value). The transition from a potential **€5 billion** yield to a **€100 million** actual yield for the Holding Tax illustrates the legislative firewall protecting mobile capital. The amendments serve a dual purpose: the Assembly uses them to signal "Tax Justice," while the Senate uses them to perform "Fiscal Signaling" without triggering capital flight. The resulting revenue is often symbolic, failing to address the structural deficit.

### **2\. The Redistribution of Austerity**

The budget effects a subtle but powerful redistribution. By freezing or under-indexing the upper IR brackets and fiscalizing alimony payers, the burden shifts to the upper-middle class (deciles 8 and 9). Simultaneously, the transformation of the EHPAD reduction into a credit and the protection of the first IR bracket shield the lower deciles. The cost of austerity is thus concentrated on the productive upper-middle class and public sector employees (sick leave), rather than the ultra-wealthy (whose assets are shielded in professional exemptions) or the lowest earners.

### **3\. The Fragility of the PLFSS**

The Social Security budget appears fundamentally unbalanced. The abandonment of the Medical Franchise doubling (€1bn loss) and the potential cost of Pension Reform suspension (€500m+) create a hole that the "sin taxes" (tobacco, soda) and niche levies (severance) cannot fill. The reliance on these marginal adjustments suggests that the 2026 PLFSS is a placeholder budget, likely requiring a rectifying finance law (PLFRSS) later in the year to address the solvency crisis.

### **4\. Sovereignty vs. Attractiveness in Corporate Tax**

The debates on CIR clawbacks and Share Buybacks highlight a pivot from "Attractiveness" (the dogma of 2017-2022) to "Sovereignty." The state is attempting to attach strings to its generosity. However, the clawback mechanisms are administratively heavy and fiscally light (€100m). They introduce regulatory uncertainty for multinationals, potentially chilling Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) more than the tax cost itself would warrant. The tension between the Ministry of Finance (protecting yield) and the Ministry of Industry (protecting factories) is palpable in the contradictory amendments on corporate taxation.

## **VI. Conclusion**

The 2026 budgetary exercise is a testament to the extreme difficulty of fiscal consolidation in a fragmented political landscape. The cumulative reliable yield from the revenue-raising amendments (Exit Tax, Holdings, Severance, sick leave savings) amounts to approximately **€2.5 billion to €3 billion**. This figure is dwarfed by the **€23 billion deficit** of the Social Security system and the broader state deficit.

The most potent levers—full indexation freezes (saving €6bn) or aggressive pension savings—have been politically neutralized. Consequently, the 2026 budget relies on a collection of "micro-taxes" and targeted savings that smooth the edges of the deficit but do not reverse the debt trajectory. The year 2026 will likely be marked by significant fiscal instability, as the gap between the symbolic measures adopted and the arithmetic reality of the deficit becomes undeniable.
